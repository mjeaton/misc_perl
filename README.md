misc_perl
=========

Misc perl scripts I found scattered across different machines. Most of them are really old.

- parse.pl was used when I had a csv with states and their abbreviations. I needed them in a database, so
I parsed the csv and generated sql statements. 

- backup.pl is used to backup files. I used it locally for a long time. Configure everything in backup.xml. When I 
looked at this code for the first time in many, many years, I was surprised at my use of "goto". WTF? Anyway, it's
interesting to see old code and all the comments I used to write. :-)
