		Destination = this is where the files are initially copied.  This would normally be
		a local or network drive.  Requires the trailing "\".  This folder will be created if it
		doesn't already exist.
		
		Reset archive bit = this is currently ignored.
		
		Log dir = This is the directory where backup.log is created.  Backup.log is overwritten
		each time a backup is run.  Requires the trailing "\" and this folder MUST exist.
		
		Use dates = If this option is set, the files to be backed up are placed in a dated directory under
		the Destination.
		
		cd_drive = This is the drive letter of the final destination for the backup files.  This will most
		commonly be a CD ROM drive.
		
		eject when done = if this is a CD ROM and this option is set to 1, the CD will be ejected when
		the backup is complete.
